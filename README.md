### B2B Sales Infrastructure – Newfoundland & Labrador

---

## Overview

The Territory Intelligence System is a production-grade sales infrastructure designed to create a structural advantage in B2B telecommunications sales across Newfoundland & Labrador.

This system:

1. Discovers real-world businesses using Google Places API (New)
2. Enriches them with operational and contact data
3. Extracts website content
4. Classifies opportunity fit using OpenAI
5. Scores businesses using a mobility-first revenue model
6. Exports ranked, call-ready lead sheets

This is not a scraping script.  
It is a persistent territory intelligence engine.
